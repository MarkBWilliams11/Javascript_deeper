/* 
The two mechanisms within Web Storage are as follows:

sessionStorage- maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration 
of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores).

localStorage- does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.


The Storage.getItem() - used to get item from the storage

Note: Storage.legnth- can test if object is empty or not

Storage.setItem()- is used to create new data items, and if exist updates values

Storage event- is fired when change is maed to the stroage object

Storage.removeItem()- takes single argument- the key data item you want to remove, and 
removes it from the storage object

stroage.clear- takes two arguments, and empties the entire object
